# React
#I am writting  controlled React forms that will hit an external API. The API we are using is a small internal FSA APILinks to an external site. with only two routes, /signup and /authenticate.

In this workshop, I will pass the /signup route, either a username and password which will come from a React form. On success, the API will send back a token, which I can store, then pass to the server to authenticate future requests.
